# Repeated Elements Task

## Purpose
The purpose of this task is to practice implementing efficient algorithms and testing them using Python. This demonstrates the ability to work with data structures such as sets and ensures code correctness using automated tests.

## Overview
The `find_repeated_elements` function takes a list of integers and returns a list of elements that appear more than once.

## Usage
The `find_repeated_elements` function can be used as follows:

```python
from task_6.find_repeated_elements import find_repeated_elements

nums = [4, 3, 3, 1, 1, 2]
result = find_repeated_elements(nums)  
print(result)  # Output: [3, 1]
